Excuse me, sir. Seeing as how the V.P. is such a V.I.P., shouldn't we keep the P.C. on the Q.T.? 'cause if it leaks to the V.C. he could become a M.I.A. and then we'd all be put out on K.P.

Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster by your side, kid.
Hundreds of years from now, it will not matter what my bank account was, the sort of house I lived in, or the kind of car I drove... But the world may be different because I did something so bafflingly crazy that my ruins become a tourist attraction.

I'm telling you Teal'c, if we don't find a way out of this soon, I'm going to lose it. Lose it, it means go crazy. Nut. Insane. Bonzo. No longer in possession of one's faculties, three fries short of a happy meal, wacko!
I'm your density. I mean... your destiny.
In my life I have found two things of priceless worth - learning and loving. Nothing else - not fame, not power, not achievement for its own sake - can possible have the same lasting value. For when your life is over, if you can say 'I have learned' and 'I

Listen, lad. I've built this kingdom up from nothing. When I started here, all there was was swamp. All the kings said I was daft to build a castle in a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp. So, I built a second one.
Magic's all balderdash and chicanery.
Man walks down the street in a hat like that, you know he's not afraid of anything.
May I pass along my congratulations for your great interdimensional breakthrough. I'm sure, in the miserable annals of the Earth, you will be duly inscribed.
May you have safe transport to the hallowed realm. Actually, not our hallowed realm. That's for Hynerians. Go find your own hallowed realm. With the Ceremony of Passage completed, I declare you officially dead, and claim all your possessions for myself.
Maybe none of this is about control. Maybe it really isn't about who can own whom, who can do what to whom and get away with it, even as far as death. Maybe it isn't about who can sit and who has to kneel or stand or lie down, legs spread open. Maybe it's

No, look, there's a blue box. It's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. It can go anywhere in time and space and sometimes even where it's meant to go. And when it turns up, there's a bloke in it called The Doctor and there will be stuff wrong a
Not all pain is gain.
Not that I condone fascism, or any -ism for that matter. -Ism's in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an -ism, he should believe in himself. I quote John Lennon, I don't believe in The Beatles, I just believe in me.

People will look at the ashes of Westerburg and say, Now there's a school that self-destructed, not because society didn't care, but because the school was society. Now that's deep.
Perfection [in design] is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

The life of a repo man is always intense.
The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable
The sky is blue.
The story so far: In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
The thing about happiness is that you only know you had it when it's gone. I mean, you may think to yourself that you're happy, but you don't really believe it. You focus on the petty bullshit, or the next job, or whatever. It's only looking back by compar
The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it.
The twins keep us on Centarian time. It's a 37-hour day. Give it a few months, you'll get used to it, or you'll have a psychotic episode.
The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?
The wise Sir Bedemir was the first to join King Arthur's knights, but other illustrious names were soon to follow: Sir Launcelot the Brave; Sir Galahad the Pure; and Sir Robin the Not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Launcelot who had nearly fought the Dragon of Agno
There are many mysteries, many unanswerable questions, even in a life as short as yours.
There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
There can be only one! 
There is an expression in the Wasteland: "Old World Blues." It refers to those so obsessed with the past they can't see the present, much less the future, for what it is.
There is no spoon.
There's no reason to become alarmed, and we hope you'll enjoy the rest of your flight.  By the way, is there anyone on board who knows how to fly a plane?
There's so much comedy on television. Does that cause comedy in the streets?
These arent the droids youre looking for.
These go to eleven.
They all adore him. They think he's a righteous dude.
They asked me how well I understood theoretical physics. I said I had a theoretical degree in physics. They said welcome aboard.
They invade our space and we fall back. They assimilate entire worlds and we fall back. Not again. The line must be drawn here!

Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.
Time is what turns kittens into cats.
Time wounds all heels.

Well, my time of not taking you seriously is coming to a middle.
We're all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it, that's all.
We're all very different people. We're not Watusi. We're not Spartans. We're Americans, with a capital 'A', huh? You know what that means? Do ya? That means that our forefathers were kicked out of every decent country in the world. We are the wretched refu
